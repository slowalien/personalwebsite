abstract = {To manage user-generated harmful video content, YouTube relies on AI algorithms (e.g.,
machine learning) in content moderation and follows a retributive justice logic to
punish convicted YouTubers through demonetization, a penalty that limits or deprives
them of advertisements (ads), reducing their future ad income. Moderation research
is burgeoning in CSCW, but relatively little attention has been paid to the socioeconomic
implications of YouTube's algorithmic moderation. Drawing from the lens of algorithmic
labor, we describe how algorithmic moderation shapes YouTubers' labor conditions through
algorithmic opacity and precarity. YouTubers coped with such challenges from algorithmic
moderation by sharing and applying practical knowledge they learned about moderation
algorithms. By analyzing video content creation as algorithmic labor, we unpack the
socioeconomic implications of algorithmic moderation and point to necessary post-punishment
support as a form of restorative justice. Lastly, we put forward design considerations
for algorithmic moderation systems.},
