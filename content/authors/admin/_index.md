I am currently a third-year Ph.D. student in Human-computer interaction (**HCI**), at Pennsylvania State University's [College of Information Sciences and Technology](https://ist.psu.edu/), where I am advised by [Dr. Yubo Kou](https://www.yubokou.info/). 

I am passionate about studying questions regarding HCI, social media **content moderation**, and how **content creator/influencer's experiences** under creator governance (e.g., content rules, monetization, recommendation algorithms, content moderation) through mixed methods.

Recently, I work on projects of investigating how (1) players from online multiplayer games and (2) content creators from **multiple** platforms such as TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, Twitch and more, interact with technologies and people, separately.
