Problem Statement Esports, like traditional sports, face governance challenges. Like traditional sports such as basketball and football, esports faces governance challenges such as foul play, aggressive behaviors on competitive scene, and match fixing, and has the need to govern its participants such as professional players and teams.\nHowever, the esports industry has seen various attempts at governance structure but is yet to form a consensus and relatively less attention has been paid to how esports authorities interpret and enforce rules in their governance ecosystem.\n2. Research Question RQ1: What behavior is conceived by the game publisher as rule breaking? RQ2: How do contextual factors influence rule enforcement?  RQ2.1: How does the location of rule breaking influence rule enforcement? RQ2.2: How does the time of rule breaking influence rule enforcement?  3. Methods   RQ1 - Content analysis on the online archive data\n  RQ2 - A series of statistical analysis: Cramer‚Äôs V, Pearson‚Äôs correlation, and Kruskal-Wallis H test on the content analysis results\n  4. Findings 4.1 Qualitative Findings 11 types of ruling-breaking behaviors corresponded to different penalty severity.   Frequencies of Rule Breaking Behaviors from August 2012 to June 2021  4.1 Quantitaitve Findings 4.1.1 Contextual factors influence rule enforcement The quantitative findings unpack the relationship between contextual factors and rule enforcement in Riot‚Äôs competitive rulings. In each competitive ruling, Riot determined the type of rule breaking behavior, and then issued a penalty. Next, we uncover how contextual factors are associated with penalty severity and then probe the internal relationship of penalty severity. Finally, we verify the impact of region and perpetrator identity on the distribution of penalty severity.\n4.1.2 Region matters in rule enforcement We found a moderate/medium association between region and three variables, including year, punishment hierarchy, and if fined (Cramer‚Äôs V coefficient, 0.3 \u0026lt; Œ¶c \u0026lt; 0.5). This result suggested that each region might proportionally have its different dominated punishment hierarchy score and adjudication of fine, released by the game publisher in a specific year.\n  Cramer‚Äôs V results  Kruskal-Wallis (K-W) H test To probe the second research question deeper, we ran independent-samples Kruskal-Wallis (K-W) H test to uncover how region affects the distribution of penalty hierarchy. We found that at least one region‚Äôs penalty hierarchy distribution was significantly different from other regions with the K-W test result, H (11) = 103.82, p-value \u0026lt; 0.001. However, this result did not inform us where the difference between different regions‚Äô penalty distribution appeared. We thus conducted the post-hoc test, the Dunn-Bonferroni method, to generate a pairwise comparison between regions and penalty hierarchy scores, as shown below. To maintain a lower type-I error, the multiple p-values of each pair of regions‚Äô penalty hierarchy have been adjusted to be adjusted coefficients through Bonferroni error correction.\n  Pairwise comparison of penalty hierarchy distribution in regions after post-hoc test  4.1.3 Penalties are progressively harsher on a yearly basis. We further ran the Pearson‚Äôs correlation on all ordinal and ratio variables to uncover the linear relationship inside penalty severity and year, as shown in Table 4. We found a weak positive correlation between year and punishment hierarchy (Pearson r = 0.15, p-value \u0026lt; 0.01), implying that the game publisher has progressively released severer penalties over the years. Also, we found that inside of penalty severity, the fine adjudication had weak positive correlation with penalty hierarchy (r = -0.38, p-value \u0026lt; 0.01), penalty quantity per perpetrator (r = 0.21, p-value \u0026lt; 0.01), and fine amount (r = 0.13, p-value = 0.002). This finding suggested that when a game publisher issued a lower level of penalty, it was more likely to appear with a fine adjudication. Also, when a perpetrator received a fine adjudication with a specific fine amount, they are more likely to have more than one penalty. This suggested that fine adjudication more likely acted as a joint penalty with other heavier ones. Collectively, these findings suggest the increasing severity of penalty over the ten-year period.\n  Pearson‚Äôs Correlation results    Scatter Plot (time series) of Penalty Hierarchy  Summary We showed that rule enforcement in LoL esports is not static but highly contextualized. The severity of penalty correlates with several contextual factors such as year and region.\n5. Discussions   We identified several conspicuous characteristics of rule enforcement in the esports governance of LoL.\n  The behavioral scope rule enforcement concerns is far-reaching. ‚Ä¶","date":1631404800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1631404800,"objectID":"01af908bfcaecb087a0232ff709b627e","permalink":"https://renkaima.xyz/portfolio/b-esports_governance/","publishdate":"2021-09-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/portfolio/b-esports_governance/","section":"portfolio","summary":"A project I **facilitate** with the PI, Dr. Yubo Kou to understand how esports gamers experience punishments issued by moderation systems, how they reason about moderation mechanisms, and how they adjust their future behaviors.","tags":null,"title":"Online Community Moderation","type":"portfolio"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Paper 1 is acceptated at CSCW\u0026#39; 2021: ‚ÄúHow advertiser-friendly is my video?‚Äù: YouTuber‚Äôs Socioeconomic Interactions with Algorithmic Content Moderation | My role:  All procedures including data collection and analysis Theoretical development, writing, and presenting  | Guided by my advisor:  Editing, revision and supervision  * Please see video presentation here:   1.

When YouTube deems a YouTuber‚Äôs video as unacceptable, YouTube will demonetize üíµ üí≤ a YouTuber‚Äôs videos or channels, eventually denying them from earning more future ad revenue through placing limited or no ads on the videos.\nContent moderation originally refers to mechanisms of ruling abuse and facilitating cooperation in online platforms, and now thus can become a source of socioeconomic punishment on video sharing platforms like YouTube or TikTok, beyond the suppression of expression online.\nThis Creator Moderation consists of multiple governance mechanisms managing content creators‚Äô visibility, identity, revenue, labor, and more. Given platformization and monetization of creative labor, video sharing platforms like YouTube and TikTok tend to practice creator moderation through an assemblage of various algorithms (e.g., monetization, content moderation, recommendation algorithms, and more). So, creators may correspondingly experience moderation such as demonetization or shadowban.
